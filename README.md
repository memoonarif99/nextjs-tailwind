This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Once the server is running, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view your application.

You can begin editing the app by modifying the app/page.tsx file. Any changes you make will automatically reflect on the page.

This project leverages next/font to optimize and load the Inter font, a custom Google Font.
